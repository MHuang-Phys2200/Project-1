Project-1
=========
Goals
---------------------
The goal of this project is to use two different series to calculate PI to a certan degree of 
error and compare the times of each series. The two series that will be used are the Leibniz
series and the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series.

Results
---------------------
The Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series is significantly faster than the Leibniz series. This is 
because the Leibniz series needs to calculate over a million terms to get a error less than 10^-6,
while the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series only needs to calculate four.
